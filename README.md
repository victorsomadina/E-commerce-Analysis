# Issue 1 
#### Identify outliers or anomalies in the dataset, such as unusually large orders or frequent returns, and what factors might explain them?
This problem was approached using Python to extract the data, and creating algorithms to check and filter the outliers, determine the factors causing the outliers which is actually inappropriate and ineffective data collection strategy in the UK, then clean out the data containing the outliers as it will introduce biasness to the further analysis to be carried out in Power BI.

# Issue 2
#### Identify and explain important metrics in the dataset.
Using Power BI, I extracted important metrics as it relates to our analysis. The most important is seeing how the business thrived between 2010 and 2011. The image below shows the massive increase in revenue generation.

Sequel to this, let's now investigate the products that might have aided in the generation of this massive revenue. The visual below shows the top 10 products with the highest revenue generated.

# Issue 3
#### What is the month-over-month rate in revenue for each product category, and how does it compare to overall revenue growth?
Gaining more insights into the performance of this massive revenue generated in 2011, we want to understand the revenue performance month over month

March, May, September, November appears to be the months that generated the highest revenue 

# Issue 4 
#### Create a geographical heat map showing the distribution of customer orders by country, and identify any regions with particularly high or low sales activity?
There is a need to understand geographical areas with the highest orders. This also gives insights on regions with high customer density, which will help determine how we strategize to increase sales and revenue in the coming years.

The map shows that the UK appears to be the region with the highest customers' orders. 

# Issue 5
#### Identify any seasonal trends or patterns in customer purchasing behaviour over the years.
Finally, we want to understand the seasonal trends based the customer purchases. This means we want to understand quantity of products purchased across months.
